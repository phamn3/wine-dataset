### Wine Dataset
__Goal:__ Use 13 attributes of chemical analysis to determine which cultivar each sample of wine was derived from. There are a total of three different cultivars. The original data folder and data set description can be found __[here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine)__. For ease of use, I copied the data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository into a csv and added the appropriate attribute headings manually (as noted in the data descriptions). 

### Wine Quality Dataset
There are two datasets associated with this wine quality problem pertaining to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine (may be found __[here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality)__. There are a total of 11 physiochemical inputs and one sensory output that indicates the quality score of a particular wine sample. The quality score was computed by calculating the median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts.   
__Goal:__ Utilizing data from only the white wine dataset, predict the quality of wine samples using the available objective data of 11 physiochemical properties.
